By default, sed only works on the first iteration of the search criteria.
Flags help us modify that when necessary.

.....................................................................
# (number)              substitute every # occurance per line

g                       sed should substitute EVERY occurance

p                       PRINT, typically used in conjunction with -n(don't print)
